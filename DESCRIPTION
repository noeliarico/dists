Description: General interface for calculating distance between objects.
   The package aims to provide a common interface for computing distance 
   functions using a function called distance() with a parameter 
   containing the name of the distance to be used (Euclidean, 
   Jaccard, Manhattan, Cosine...). Also, it works with tibbles 
   as input instead of matrices (dist() classic function 
   only works with matrices). The distances are computed 
   in C to speed up the execution.
